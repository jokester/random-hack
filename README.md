# Random hack

---

Random hacks I found work, mostly about open-source packages / Web platform.

- crossdomain-ajax-with-yql
    - bypass CORS restriction of browser JavaScript, by making use of `Yahoo Query Language` API.
- pdfkit-webpack-for-browser
    - bundle pdfkit and its dependecies for use in browser
