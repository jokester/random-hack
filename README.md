# Random hack

---

Random hacks I found works, mostly about open-source packages / Web platform.

- crossdomain-ajax-with-yql
    - bypass CORS restriction of browser JavaScript, by making use of `Yahoo Query Language` API.
- pdfkit-webpack
    - bundle pdfkit and its dependecies for use in browser, with webpack
- threejs-control-webpack-ts
    - bundle and use `three/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls` with webpack + TypeScript
